2. **Web Workers**: Offloads user grouping to prevent UI blocking
3. **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimized Angular change detection
4. **Reactive State Management**: Uses Angular 18 signals for optimal reactivity
5. **Debounced Search**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive filtering
6. **Memory Optimization**: Efficient data structures and cleanup

### Code Quality & Structure
- **Standalone Components**: Modern Angular 18 architecture
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Type safety and better developer experience  
- **SCSS with Design System**: Consistent styling using awork's design tokens
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with services
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS for async operations and state management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### User Experience
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and Angular animations
- **Loading States**: Multiple loading indicators for different operations
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data is available
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Web Worker Grouping
```typescript
this.userGroupingService.groupUsers(users, 'nationality');
```

### Virtual Scrolling
```html
<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport [itemSize]="itemSize">
  <div *cdkVirtualFor="let user of users; trackBy: trackByUserId">
  </div>
</cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>
```

### Reactive Search
```typescript
this.searchSubject.pipe(
  debounceTime(300),
  distinctUntilChanged()
).subscribe(term => this.performSearch(term));
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Bundle size optimized with lazy loading
- Change detection optimized with OnPush strategy
